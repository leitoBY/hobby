### Setup and run
1. To setup and run project you need to install requirements first. Also, I recommend to use virtual environment.
>pip install -r requirements.txt

2. I used here mysql database. You need to run one at your local, and change path for it in *connection.py* file.
Should work with different databases, but i didn't test it as well

3. To run server - activate venv, if need and type:
>python server.py

4. Checkout your http://localhost:5000
